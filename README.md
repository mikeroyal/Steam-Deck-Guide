[Steam OS 3.0](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) is an [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) Operating System(OS) using the [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop) desktop. This allows you to install applications in containers using [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), rather than onto the root filesystem. This means not only that the installation of applications is isolated from the core filesystem, but also that the ability for malicious applications to compromise/break your system is significantly reduced.

[Steam Hardware GitLab Repo](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/SteamDeck/hardware) is a repository that contains CAD files for the external shell (surface topology) of Steam Deck, under a Creative Commons license. This includes an STP model, STL model, and drawings (DWG) for reference.

[Dynamic Cloud Sync](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3142949576401813670) is a tool that Steam will use  to automatically upload all modified save game data to the cloud prior to the device entering sleep mode. Users can then resume their game on any PC, laptop or other device. Steam will also automatically download any save game changes when users return to their Steam Deck and wake up the device.

[Steam Cloud](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud) is a tool that provides an easy and transparent remote file storage system for your game. Files specified in the Auto-Cloud configuration or written to disk (created, modified, deleted, etc.) using the Cloud API will automatically be replicated to the Steam servers after the game exits. If the user changes computers, the files are automatically downloaded to the new computer prior to the game launching. The game can then access the files by reading them through the Cloud API or reading them directly from disk as usual. Avoid machine specific configurations such as video settings.

[Gamescope](https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope) is a SteamOS session micro-compositing window manager formerly known as [steamcompmgr](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamos-compositor).

[AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-fidelityfx) is an open source, high-quality solution for producing high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs.

[AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.0](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2022-03-17-introducing-amd-software-adrenalin-edition-2022-release-and-amd) is an open source, high-quality solution for producing high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs. It uses temporal data and optimized anti-aliasing to boost framerates in supported games while delivering similar or better image quality than native resolution without requiring dedicated machine learning hardware. AMD FSR 2.0 will be available some time Q2 2022.

[MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) is a Vulkan and OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more.

[GOverlay](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay) is an open source project aimed to create a Graphical UI to manage Vulkan/OpenGL overlays. It is still in early development.

[ReplaySorcery](https://github.com/matanui159/ReplaySorcery) is an open-source, instant-replay solution for Linux.

[Luxtorpeda](https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda) is a Steam Play compatibility tool to run games using native Linux engines.

[SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/projects) is a huge database where you can download and share custom video game assets and personalize your gaming library.

[SGDBoop](https://www.steamgriddb.com/boop) is a tool that automatically applies assets from SteamGridDB directly to your Steam library with a click of a button, removing the need to download and set them manually. [Available as a Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.steamgriddb.SGDBoop)

[Deck Verified](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified) is a program that reviews games in Steam's catalog verifying their compatibility with the Steam Deck. So when you visit your Library on Steam Deck, you’ll find a compatibility badge on each title, reflecting the kind of experience you can expect when playing each game on Steam Deck.

The DirectX API is architected in a way that takes all this into account and maximizes performance throughout the entire pipeline from NVMe drive all the way to the GPU. It does this in several ways: by reducing per-request NVMe overhead, enabling batched many-at-a-time parallel IO requests which can be efficiently fed to the GPU, and giving games finer grain control over when they get notified of IO request completion instead of having to react to every tiny IO completion. The DirectStorage API will be available on [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11) PCs with NVMe SSDs, but will also be support in [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) version 1909 and newer.

## Audio Tools

[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines. It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy. Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing.

[WirePlumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/) is a modular session / policy manager for [PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) and a GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API, providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire. The WirePlumber daemon implements the session & policy management service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement the actual management functionality.

[Core API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__core.html) is used by all clients that need to communicate with the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) and provides the necessary structs to interface with the daemon.

[Implementation API](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__pw__impl.html) is primarily used by the [PipeWire Daemon](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_daemon.html) itself but also by the [PipeWire Session Manager](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_session_manager.html) and modules/extensions that need to build objects in the graph.

[SPA (Simple Plugin API)](https://docs.pipewire.org/group__api__spa.html) is an extensible API to implement all kinds of plugins.

[GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently.

[Media Source Extensions (MSE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/) is a [W3C specification](https://github.com/w3c/media-source) that allows JavaScript to send byte streams to media codecs within Web browsers that support HTML5 video and audio. Also, this allows the implementation of client-side prefetching and buffering code for streaming media entirely in JavaScript.

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is an open-source project that adds real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions.
